# Linux Labs â€“ AWS re/Start

This repository contains my completed Linux labs from the **AWS re/Start** program. Each lab helped build my foundational skills in Linux system administration, working primarily in a cloud-based environment using Amazon EC2.

The labs cover real-world tasks such as managing users, handling permissions, working with system processes, using the command line efficiently, and writing basic shell scripts. All work was done on live Linux instances using standard tools and commands.
